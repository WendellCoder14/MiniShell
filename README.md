### What is is?
MiniShell is a tiny userland "OS" made in Python. It uses a custom filesystem called **VirtualFS** which is open-source and you can use it in your projects.

### Which Python version is recommended?
MiniShell was made in **Python 3.9 *x64***, but any version upper then might work (never use Python 2 because it uses f-strings)

### Is it intended to actual real use?
No, because still experimental and there still some bugs.

### Which Windows version is reccomended?
MiniShell also has support to Windows thanks by [PyInstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller).
MiniShell was built using Windows 11 ARM64

### Who made this?
My name is Wendell but just call me WCode2K (or WendellCoder14, idk) and i live in Brazil.
This project took a few days to the initial version, so i'm kinda proud of myself
